    description: "The Chevrolet Celta was a subcompact car developed specifically for the South American market, particularly Brazil. Built on GM's 4200 platform, a simplified evolution of the Opel Corsa B architecture, it was designed to be an affordable, entry-level vehicle with low production and maintenance costs. Initially available only as a three-door hatchback, a five-door variant was added in 2002. Throughout its production, the Celta was powered by 1.0L and 1.4L gasoline engines, with flex-fuel capability (able to run on ethanol) added in 2005. The interior was basic and functional, focusing on durability rather than luxury. A significant facelift in 2006 updated the front fascia to align with Chevrolet's global design language, while additional minor updates throughout its life added features like power steering, air conditioning, and basic safety equipment. Despite its simplicity, the Celta became one of Brazil's best-selling cars due to its affordability, reliability, and low operating costs. Production ended in 2015 when it was effectively replaced by the Chevrolet Onix in GM's Brazilian lineup. The Celta represented an important strategic model for GM in developing markets, demonstrating how global platforms could be adapted and simplified for specific regional requirements and price points."
